# MExN Example App

Simple app built to demonstrate the use and implementation of the MExN stack (MongoDB, Express and NodeJS)


## Topics covered:
- Creation of mongoose schemas with fields validation
- Initialization and use of express as web applications framework, to create a RESTful API
- Simple CRUD for the created schema taking advantage of request parameters and queries
- Creation of basic middlewares for express
- UI rendered using `html` and `pug` files and sending variables to them
- Use of `nodemon`
- MVC pattern

**Note:**

We leave the x in MExN for every one to use their preferred UI framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
